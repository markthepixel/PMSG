# Delivering Presentations and Demos

Delivering presentations and demos involves presenting information or showcasing a product in a clear, engaging, and persuasive. This skill is crucial in various scenarios, such as pitching a new feature to stakeholders, training your team on a new tool, or demonstrating the functionality of your product to customers.

## Example

Consider a Product Manager at a computer hardware company, such as Apple, who is tasked with presenting a new smartphone feature, "Tap to Share Contact Info," to stakeholders. The Product Manager prepares a comprehensive presentation highlighting the new feature's benefits, such as ease of use and time efficiency, its market potential, and how it aligns with the companyâ€™s strategic goals of enhancing user experience and staying ahead of competitors.

To prepare the demo, the Product Manager collaborates with the design and engineering teams to ensure the feature is feasible. They plan a user journey that showcases how the feature works - from tapping the contact info to sharing it with another user. They also anticipate potential questions from stakeholders, such as privacy concerns and compatibility issues, and prepare responses in advance.

During the presentation, the Product Manager walks the stakeholders through the demo, explaining each step of the user journey. They highlight how the feature enhances the user experience and sets the company apart from its competitors. The combination of the presentation and demo helps the stakeholders visualize the feature's value, increasing the likelihood of gaining their support.

## Pain Points

Creating engaging presentations and demos can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex information or skeptical audiences. It's also important to handle questions and feedback effectively. You need to be prepared to address concerns, provide additional information, and demonstrate your presentation's value.

## Practical Exercise

Choose a feature of your product. How would you present it to a non-technical audience? Consider the key points you would highlight, how you would explain its functionality, and how you would demonstrate its value.
