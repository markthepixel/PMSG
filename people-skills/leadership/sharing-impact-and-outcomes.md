# Sharing Impact and Outcomes

Sharing impact and outcomes involves communicating the results of product initiatives to stakeholders, including the team, leadership, and external parties. This includes both the direct outcomes of the product's performance and the broader impact on business objectives. Sharing impact and outcomes is crucial for demonstrating the value of the product, informing decision-making, and fostering a culture of transparency and accountability.

## Example

Consider a Product Manager at Spotify, a leading music streaming service. They have recently overseen the launch of a new feature that allows users to create collaborative playlists. After the feature has been live for a few months, the Product Manager prepares to share the impact and outcomes with the team and stakeholders.

To do this, they gather data on user engagement with the new feature, such as the number of collaborative playlists created, the increase in user session length, and any changes in user retention rates. They also collect qualitative feedback from users through surveys and user interviews, capturing how the feature has improved their experience.

In a team meeting, the Product Manager presents these findings, sharing specific metrics and user testimonials to demonstrate the impact of the new feature. They highlight how the feature has increased user engagement and improved the user experience, aligning with Spotify's mission to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.

The Product Manager also shares these outcomes with stakeholders in a report, providing a clear demonstration of the feature's success and its contribution to Spotify's overall business objectives. This process of sharing impact and outcomes helps to validate the work of the team, inform future product decisions, and maintain stakeholder support.

## Pain Points

Sharing impact and outcomes can be challenging due to the need to collect and analyze data, the potential complexity of the results, and the need to communicate these in a clear and compelling way. It can also be difficult to balance the desire to highlight successes with the need to be honest about challenges or shortcomings.

## Practical Exercise

~~Think about a recent product initiative you were involved in. How would you go about collecting data to assess its impact and outcomes? How would you communicate these results to different stakeholders? What key points would you want to highlight, and how would you handle any negative results or feedback?~~
