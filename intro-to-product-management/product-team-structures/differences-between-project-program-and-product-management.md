# Differences between Project, Program, and Product Management

Product, project, and program management are three distinct disciplines, each with its unique focus and responsibilities. While they all involve guiding a team toward a goal, their approaches and outcomes differ. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective collaboration, ensuring each role's unique contributions are leveraged effectively. Itâ€™s important to note that a Product Owner is another name for a Project Manager, but some companies use it as a title for Product Managers.

## Example

At a large and diverse tech company like Oracle, the roles might be divided as follows:

Product managers develop new features and products, focusing on delivering a product that provides value to customers and meets business goals.

Project managers might handle the implementation of this software for a specific client, focusing on executing a specific project within a given timeframe and budget.

Program managers might oversee several such implementations, coordinating related projects to achieve a larger business objective, such as expanding to a new region.

## Pain Points

Role confusion can be a significant challenge when understanding product, project, and program management differences. It's also important to align objectives across these roles, as misalignment can lead to inefficiencies and conflicts.

## Practical Exercise

Research the roles of project, program, and Product Managers in tech companies. How do they differ from each other? How do their responsibilities align and diverge?
