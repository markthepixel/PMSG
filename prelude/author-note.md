# A Note From The Author

**Hello** :wave: **I am** [**Mark Progano**](https://mprogano.com)**â€”**

Over the past 5+ years, I have had the privilege of mentoring new and aspiring Product Managers. Throughout this journey, I've observed a significant gap in the resources available to those seeking to excel in this dynamic and challenging role.

While there are _countless_ courses and guides on how to land a job as a Product Manager, few delve into the core skills required to thrive in the role. Even fewer provide detailed, _real-world examples_ that illuminate these skills in action.



**This guide is my response to that gap** and is designed to go beyond the interview preparation and job-hunting advice that saturates the market.

Instead, it focuses on the full spectrum of skills that underpin successful product management. From strategic thinking to cross-functional collaboration, from customer understanding to data-driven decision-making, this guide explores the multifaceted nature of the Product Manager's role.

Each section of this guide includes detailed examples providing a practical context for the skills and concepts discussed. These examples serve as a bridge between theory and practice, helping you understand what a Product Manager does and how they do it.



**This guide is a labor of love**, my wife (an amazing creative, product designer, and low-key PM) and I spent countless hours building up the structure, outlining each page, and write (and then rewriting) real-world examples.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">It is our hope this guide will serve as a comprehensive foundation for anyone aspiring to become a Product Manager.</mark>

Whether you're just starting your journey or looking to refine your existing skills, I believe understanding and mastering these core skills is key to long-term success in product management.



Whether you're preparing for your first Product Manager role or looking to level up your skills, I invite you to dig into this guide, explore the breadth and depth of what it means to be a Product Manager and use this knowledge as a springboard for your career.&#x20;
