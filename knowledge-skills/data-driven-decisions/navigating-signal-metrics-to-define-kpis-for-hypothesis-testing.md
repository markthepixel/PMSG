# Navigating Signal Metrics to Define KPIs for Hypothesis Testing

For Product Managers, discerning which metrics serve as reliable signals for hypothesis testing is a foundational skill. Signals are indications of behavior or performance, while metrics are quantifiable measures that track these signals over time. Understanding the relationship between signals, metrics, and KPIs is essential for selecting a KPI that will provide clear insights into the hypothesis being tested. This section will elucidate the process of identifying signal metrics that will inform the choice of an effective KPI.

## Example

The Product Manager at YouTube wants to ensure that the introduction of personalized learning paths leads to increased user engagement. To start, they list out potential signals of engagement, such as the frequency of visits, the diversity of content consumed, and the interaction with the content (likes, shares, comments). Each of these signals can be measured through specific metrics: visit frequency can be measured by 'Sessions per User,' content diversity by 'Number of Categories Watched,' and interaction by 'Engagement Actions per Session.'

After evaluating the signals and corresponding metrics, the PM chooses 'Average Session Length' as the primary KPI because it is a strong signal of user engagement, directly tied to the hypothesis. To complement this, 'Engagement Actions per Session' is selected as a secondary KPI, providing insight into the quality of engagement during these longer sessions.

To validate the effectiveness of these KPIs, the PM ensures that they are S.M.A.R.T. - Specific to the hypothesis, Measurable via the platform’s analytics, Actionable in informing product decisions, Relevant to user engagement goals, and Time-bound within the constraints of the testing period.

## Pain Points

The challenge lies in filtering through numerous potential metrics to find the ones that best signal changes relevant to the hypothesis. New PMs often grapple with understanding which metrics will act as true indicators of success and how to prioritize them. There is a risk of focusing on 'vanity metrics' that look impressive but don’t provide actionable insights.

## Practical Exercise

Think of an improvement you'd like to see in a product. What behaviors or outcomes are you trying to influence? List out all the possible signals associated with these behaviors. Determine which metrics can effectively measure these signals. From these metrics, select one that could serve as a primary KPI and another as a secondary KPI for your hypothesis. Explain your rationale.
