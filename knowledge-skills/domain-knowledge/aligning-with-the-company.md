# Aligning with the Company

A deep understanding of a company's direction, strengths, and market positioning is crucial for Product Managers. They must align product capabilities with the company's broader goals to ensure that product development efforts contribute to the overall success of the organization. This section will discuss how Product Managers can align product features, technological innovations, and user needs with the strategic objectives of their company.

## Example

At GoodRx, the Product Manager recognizes the strategic goal of becoming the leading platform for healthcare savings. To contribute to this goal, they consider the company's strengths — a robust database of drug prices, strong relationships with pharmacies, and a loyal user base. The PM seeks to align new features with these strengths, ensuring that each innovation is not just a technological advancement but also a strategic one.

The PM proposes enhancing the platform's data analytics capabilities to provide more personalized savings recommendations, aligning with the strategic goal of user engagement and retention. They also advocate for leveraging pharmacy relationships to create exclusive discounts, reinforcing GoodRx's market positioning.

In addition to aligning features with strategic goals, the PM ensures that product development timelines and resource allocations are in sync with the company's roadmaps and key milestones. They work with cross-functional teams to prioritize projects that drive the most strategic value and are feasible within the company's operational capabilities.

## Pain Points

Product Managers often face challenges in prioritizing features that align with strategy while managing resource constraints and navigating cross-departmental dependencies. They must also ensure that strategic alignment does not come at the expense of user needs and market trends.

## Practical Exercise

Take a look at a popular consumer app that you frequently use. Think about the app's main goal — it could be connecting people, organizing work, providing entertainment, or something else. Identify one feature of the app and consider how it helps achieve that main goal. Then, brainstorm a simple enhancement or a new feature that could make the app even more aligned with its goal, and think about what would make this change successful from a user's perspective.
