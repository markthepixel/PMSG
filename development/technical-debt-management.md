# Technical Debt Management

Technical debt, also known as tech debt, refers to the consequences that arise when development teams expedite the delivery of a piece of functionality or a project that later needs to be refactored. In other words, it's the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code. It's a common occurrence in software development and, if not managed properly, can create problems for users, lead to a decrease in productivity, and an increase in the time it takes to deliver new features.

Managing technical debt involves making strategic decisions about when to take on debt and when to pay it off. This requires a clear understanding of the trade-offs involved and the potential impact on the end-users, the product, and the team. It's about balancing the need for speed and innovation with the need for maintainability and stability.

## Example

Let's go back to the professional networking example one last time. After the successful launch of the "Enhanced Job Filtering" feature, the Product Manager and the development team notice that the implementation of the feature has resulted in some technical debt. For instance, to expedite the delivery of the feature, the team had to make some compromises in the code quality and architecture. This has led to a decrease in the system's performance and an increase in the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and extend.

Recognizing the potential long-term impact of this technical debt, the Product Manager decides to address it by making room for clean up in the upcoming cycles. They collaborate with the development team to identify the areas of the codebase that are most affected by the technical debt and estimate the effort required to refactor them. They also consider the potential impact on the product's performance and the team's productivity.

Based on this analysis, the Product Manager prioritizes the technical debt items in the product backlog, alongside new features and improvements. They decide to allocate a portion of each sprint to addressing technical debt, ensuring that it doesn't accumulate to a point where it becomes unmanageable.

Throughout this process, the Product Manager communicates with leadership and stakeholders, explaining the importance of managing technical debt and its impact on the product's long-term success. They also ensure that the team has the necessary resources and support to address the technical debt effectively.

## Pain Points

Managing technical debt can be challenging as it requires balancing the need for new features and improvements with the need to maintain a healthy and maintainable codebase. It also requires clear communication with leadership and stakeholders about the importance of addressing technical debt and its impact on the product's long-term success.

## Practical Exercise

Imagine you worked at LinkedIn and youâ€™re launching the Enhanced Job Filtering feature. What would you imagine are some possible technical debt that may have accumulated? How would you prioritize addressing this technical debt? What would be the potential impact on the product and the team if this technical debt is not addressed? Research related features and make assumptions where information is not available.
