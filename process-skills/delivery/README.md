# Delivery

Delivery in product management is the point at which complete product specifications are handed over to the development team or engineers to be designed, built, and implemented. This phase involves the actual deployment of the product or feature to the end-users. It includes activities such as roll-out and release management, monitoring and analyzing product performance, and gathering user feedback for continuous improvement. The delivery phase requires close collaboration with various teams, including engineering, marketing, sales, and customer support, to ensure a successful product launch and ongoing product success.
