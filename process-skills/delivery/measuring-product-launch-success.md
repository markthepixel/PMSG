# Measuring Product Launch Success

Measuring product launch success involves evaluating the performance of a new product or feature against predefined key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs can include metrics related to user engagement, adoption rates, revenue generation, customer satisfaction, and more. The specific KPIs used to measure success will depend on the goals of the product launch and the nature of the product itself. This process is key for understanding the impact of the product or feature on user behavior, business outcomes, and strategic objectives. The insights gained from this process can inform future product development efforts and strategic decisions.

## Example

Let's continue with the scooter rental company. After the launch of the new feature that allows users to reserve scooters in advance, the Product Manager starts to measure the success of the launch. They had defined success metrics (the KPIs) in the PRD, which included an increase in the number of rides booked in advance by 20% within the first month, a decrease in last-minute cancellations by 10%, and positive user feedback on the new feature.

To measure these key metrics, the Product Manager uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. They analyze usage data from the app to track the number of rides booked in advance and the number of last-minute cancellations. They also monitor user feedback through app reviews, customer support tickets, and user surveys to understand user sentiment towards the new feature.

After a month, the Product Manager finds that the number of rides booked in advance has increased by 25%, exceeding their target. However, the number of last-minute cancellations has only decreased by 5%, falling short of their target. User feedback on the new feature is generally positive, with users appreciating the convenience of being able to book rides in advance.

Based on these results, the Product Manager concludes that the launch of the advanced booking feature has been largely successful. However, they also identify areas for improvement, such as further reducing last-minute cancellations. They share these insights with the team and use them to inform future product development efforts.

## Pain Points

Measuring product launch success can be challenging due to the complexity of attributing changes in user behavior and business outcomes to a specific product or feature. It can also be difficult to collect and analyze data from multiple sources, and to interpret this data in a meaningful way. Furthermore, success metrics may not always capture the full impact of a product or feature, and additional qualitative insights may be needed to fully understand user perceptions and experiences.

## Practical Exercise

Think of a product or feature you recently used or helped launch. What were the success metrics for this product or feature? How would you go about measuring these metrics? What data sources would you use? What insights could you gain from this data?
