# User Activation

User activation is when a user fully engages (or activates) with the initial set of persona-relevant key features in the product. It's the moment when your users actually get value from your product. This phase determines the success and revenue of a product in the long run. It's about converting trial users into active users who regularly use the product and derive value from it. User activation strategies can vary widely, but they often involve providing clear value propositions, simplifying onboarding processes, and offering robust customer support.

## Example

Continuing with the scooter rental company and the reserve in advance feature, the feature has been rolled out therefore it's time to activate users.

The Product Manager starts by identifying the key activation event for this feature, which is when a user successfully reserves a scooter for the first time. To drive users towards this activation event, the PM collaborates with the marketing team to create an email campaign that highlights the benefits of reserving a scooter in advance, such as ensuring availability and saving time.

The email includes a clear call-to-action that takes users directly to the reservation feature in the app. To make the process as frictionless as possible, the PM works with the UX team to streamline the reservation process, ensuring that users can reserve a scooter in just a few taps.

In addition to the email campaign, the PM also implements in-app prompts that guide users through the reservation process. These prompts are triggered based on user behavior. For example, if a user is browsing available scooters during peak hours, a prompt might appear suggesting they reserve a scooter to guarantee availability.

Throughout this process, the PM closely monitors user behavior and feedback. They notice that some users are abandoning the reservation process midway. To address this, they work with the customer support team to reach out to these users and offer assistance, uncovering that some users were confused about the pricing for reservations. As a result, the PM updates the in-app prompts to provide clearer information about reservation pricing, improving the activation rate.

## Pain Points

User activation can be challenging as it requires a deep understanding of user behavior and needs. It's also a continuous process that needs constant monitoring and optimization. PMs need to identify the right activation events, create strategies to drive users towards these events, and continuously test and iterate these strategies based on user feedback and data.

## Practical Exercise

Think about a product or feature you use regularly. What was the key activation event for you? How did the product guide you towards this event? Now, imagine you're the PM for this product. How would you improve the user activation process? Write down your ideas and discuss them with a colleague or friend.
