# Working with Designers

Working with product designers involves collaborating closely with these professionals to translate the product vision and requirements into a user-friendly and effective design. Product designers play a crucial role in the product development process, using their expertise in user experience, interaction design, and visual design to create a product that meets user needs and aligns with the product strategy.

## Example

Imagine you're a Product Manager at a social media company, like Facebook. You're working on a new feature that allows users to customize their profile layout. You've written the PRD and now it's time to work with the product designer to bring this feature to life.

In your initial meeting with the product designer, you discuss the feature's objectives and requirements. The designer suggests using a drag-and-drop interface to allow users to easily customize their profile layout. They explain that this approach is intuitive and user-friendly, and it has been successful in other products.

However, you're concerned about the technical feasibility of this approach and the potential impact on the page load time. The designer acknowledges your concerns and suggests conducting a design spike â€” a time-boxed period where they will explore the technical implications of the drag-and-drop interface and create a prototype.

After the design spike, the designer shares their findings. They've found a way to implement the drag-and-drop interface without significantly impacting the page load time. They've also created a prototype that you can test with users. Through this collaborative process, you've been able to address your concerns while also leveraging the designer's expertise to create a user-friendly feature.

## Pain Points

Working with product designers can be challenging when there are disagreements or conflicts about the design direction. It's also important to balance the need for a great user experience with technical feasibility and business constraints. At the end of the day, the best design is one that has been tested with real users.

## Practical Exercise

Think of a feature of your favorite product. How would you work with a product designer to improve this feature or product? What design decisions would you need to make, and how would you collaborate with the designer to make these decisions?
