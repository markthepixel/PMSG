# Product Vision

A product vision is a clear, inspiring statement that describes the long-term goal and purpose of your product. It answers the question: "What are we trying to achieve and why does it matter?" A strong product vision guides decision-making, aligns your team, and keeps everyone focused on delivering value to users.

## Example

For example, the product vision for a student assignment tracker app could be: "Empower students to take control of their academic life by making it easy to organize, track, and complete assignments on time."

## Pain Points

Crafting a compelling product vision can be challenging, especially if you’re not sure who your users are or what problem you’re solving. It’s easy to make the vision too broad or too vague. The vision should be ambitious but also specific enough to guide your work.

## Practical Exercise

Write a one-sentence product vision for your side project. Share it with a peer or mentor and ask if it clearly communicates the purpose and value of your product.
