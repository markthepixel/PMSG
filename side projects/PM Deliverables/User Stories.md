# User Stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or requirement told from the perspective of the end user. They help product managers and teams understand what users need and why, making it easier to prioritize and design solutions that deliver real value. A typical user story follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

## Example

For example, a user story for a student assignment tracker app could be:  
"As a student, I want to receive reminders for upcoming assignments so that I can stay organized and submit my work on time."

## Pain Points

Writing effective user stories can be challenging if you don’t have a clear understanding of your users or their needs. It’s easy to make stories too vague or too detailed, which can lead to confusion or missed requirements. Ensuring that each story is actionable and testable is key.

## Practical Exercise

Pick a feature for your side project. Write three user stories for it, each from a different user’s perspective. Review them to make sure they are clear, specific, and focused on user value.
