# Wireframes

Wireframes are basic visual representations of a product’s layout and structure. They help product managers and teams quickly communicate ideas, plan user flows, and align on the design before investing time in detailed development. Wireframes focus on functionality and placement of elements rather than colors or final visuals, making them a fast and effective way to iterate on concepts.

## Example

A wireframe for a student assignment tracker app could illustrate the main dashboard, highlighting sections for upcoming assignments, a calendar view, and an "add new task" button. This visual outline helps the team see where each element is placed on the screen and makes it easier to discuss and improve the user experience.

## Pain Points

Creating wireframes can be challenging if you’re not familiar with design tools or if requirements are unclear. It’s easy to get caught up in details or make wireframes too complex. The goal is to keep them simple and focused on layout and flow, not visual polish.

## Practical Exercise

Choose a feature from your side project and sketch a wireframe for it. You can use paper, whiteboards, or digital tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or Sketch. Share your wireframe with a peer or mentor and ask for feedback on usability and clarity.
