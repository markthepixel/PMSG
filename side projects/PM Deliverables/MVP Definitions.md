# MVP Definitions

An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the simplest version of a product that allows you to launch quickly, test your core idea, and gather feedback from real users. The goal of an MVP is to validate assumptions and learn what works before investing more time and resources into full development. MVPs help product managers focus on delivering value early and iterating based on user input.

## Example

Instead of building a full-featured product from the start, many successful teams launch with an MVP to test their core idea. For example, a student assignment tracker app might begin with just the essential features: adding assignments, setting due dates, and receiving reminders. More advanced features like calendar integration or analytics can be added later, once it’s clear that users find the basic tool helpful.

## Pain Points

Defining an MVP can be difficult because it’s tempting to include too many features. Teams may disagree on what is truly "minimum" or "viable." It’s important to prioritize ruthlessly and stay focused on solving the core problem. Releasing an MVP also means accepting that the first version won’t be perfect.

## Practical Exercise

Pick a product idea or feature from your side project. List all the features you’d like to include, then narrow it down to the absolute essentials for your MVP. Explain why you chose these features and how you would measure success after launch.
