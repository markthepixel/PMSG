# Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)

A Product Requirement Document (PRD) is a key deliverable that outlines the purpose, features, functionality, and requirements of a product or feature. PRDs help ensure that everyone on the team—designers, developers, and stakeholders—has a clear understanding of what needs to be built and why. A well-written PRD provides context, sets priorities, and serves as a reference throughout the development process.

## Example

For a student assignment tracker app, a PRD might include the problem statement, target users, key features (such as assignment reminders and calendar integration), user stories, success metrics, and any technical or design constraints. The PRD would also specify what is out of scope for the initial release.

## Pain Points

Writing a PRD can be challenging if requirements are unclear or if there are many stakeholders with different priorities. It’s important to balance detail with clarity—too much information can overwhelm, while too little can lead to misunderstandings. Keeping the PRD updated as the project evolves is also a common challenge.

## Practical Exercise

Choose a feature or product idea from your side project. Draft a simple PRD that includes a problem statement, target users, main features, and success criteria. Share it with a peer or mentor for feedback and revise it based on their suggestions.
