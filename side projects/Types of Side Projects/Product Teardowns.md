# Product Teardowns

Product teardowns are a type of side project where you systematically analyze and break down an existing product to understand its features, design choices, user flows, and business strategy. This process helps product managers develop a deeper understanding of what makes a product successful or where it falls short. By studying real products, you can learn from both their strengths and weaknesses and apply these lessons to your own projects.

## Example

A popular teardown example is the analysis of the Duolingo mobile app. PMs and designers have examined Duolingoâ€™s onboarding, gamification elements, lesson structure, and notification strategy to understand how the app drives engagement and retention. These teardowns often include annotated screenshots, user journey maps, and commentary on what works well and what could be improved. You can find similar teardowns on blogs, Medium, or product communities.

## Pain Points

Conducting a thorough product teardown can be time-consuming and requires attention to detail. It can be challenging to access all features, especially if some are behind paywalls or require long-term use. Staying objective and focusing on actionable insights rather than personal preferences is important. Be mindful of respecting intellectual property and avoid sharing proprietary information.

## Practical Exercise

Choose a product or app you use regularly. Map out its main user flows, list its core features, and analyze the design and business decisions behind them. Identify one area you think could be improved and explain why.
