# Case Studies

Case studies are a practical way for product managers to build their skills by analyzing existing products or features. This type of side project involves breaking down a product’s goals, user experience, and business impact to understand what works and what could be improved. By studying real products, you develop your product sense, learn to identify strengths and weaknesses, and practice making recommendations based on evidence.

## Example

The Product Folks community published a case study analyzing the onboarding flow of Notion, a popular note-taking app. They described Notion’s purpose and target users, walked through each onboarding step to identify what was intuitive and where users might get confused, and compared the experience to other productivity tools. The case study highlighted strengths like customization, pointed out areas for improvement such as initial complexity, and suggested specific changes. It included screenshots, user journey maps, and a summary of findings, then proposed ways to test the impact of suggested changes, such as tracking user activation rates after onboarding improvements. You can find similar case studies on [The Product Folks](https://www.theproductfolks.com/product-management-case-studies) or other product management communities for inspiration.

## Pain Points

Case studies can be challenging because you may not have access to all the data or the reasoning behind product decisions. It takes time to analyze a product thoroughly and to stay objective. You should also be mindful of privacy laws and ensure that any data you include complies with relevant regulations. Additionally, check whether the organization you are analyzing allows public case studies or external analysis. Focusing on actionable insights and clear recommendations is important.

## Practical Exercise

Pick a product or feature you use often. Write a short case study that covers its main goals, user experience, and areas for improvement. Suggest one change and describe how you would measure its success.
