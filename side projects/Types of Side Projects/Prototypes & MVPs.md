# Prototypes & MVPs

Building prototypes and MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) as side projects allows product managers to quickly test ideas and validate assumptions before investing significant resources. Prototypes are early models or mockups that demonstrate how a product or feature might work, while MVPs are functional versions with just enough features to satisfy early users and gather feedback. This approach helps you practice rapid iteration, user testing, and prioritization.

## Example

Dropbox famously started with a simple explainer video as their prototype, showing how file syncing would work. This video generated interest and collected feedback before any code was written. Later, the team built an MVP with core syncing functionality and invited early users to test it. Their feedback guided further development, helping Dropbox refine its product and grow quickly. You can apply this approach by creating clickable prototypes in Figma or building a basic MVP with limited features to validate your idea.

## Pain Points

Creating effective prototypes and MVPs can be challenging because it’s easy to overbuild or lose focus on the core problem. You may face constraints in design tools, technical skills, or user access. It’s important to prioritize essential features, avoid perfectionism, and be open to feedback and iteration. Testing with real users and learning from their responses is crucial for success.

## Practical Exercise

Pick a product idea or feature you want to test. Create a simple prototype using a tool like Figma or Sketch, or outline your MVP’s core features. Share your prototype or MVP with a few users, collect their feedback, and identify what changes would make the product more valuable.
