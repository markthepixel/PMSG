# Launching a Simple App or Tool

Launching a simple app or tool as a side project is a hands-on way for product managers to experience the full product lifecycle. This type of project involves taking an idea from concept to launch, even if the final product is basic. It helps you practice skills like ideation, scoping, prioritization, collaboration, and gathering user feedback.

## Example

A real-world example is the creation of the "Momentum" Chrome extension. The developer noticed that many people wanted a simple, visually appealing way to stay organized and motivated each day. Instead of building a complex productivity suite, they started with a basic Chrome extension that replaced the new tab page with a daily focus, to-do list, and inspirational quotes. The initial version focused on just a few features and was shared with friends and early users for feedback. Over time, based on user suggestions, the extension added more customization and integrations, growing into a popular tool used by millions. This approach could also be applied to building a simple web app or WordPress plugin that solves a focused problem, starting small and iterating based on real user feedback.

## Pain Points

Launching even a simple app can be challenging due to limited resources, technical constraints, and the need to prioritize features. It requires balancing scope with available time and skills, and being comfortable with releasing an imperfect product. Gathering meaningful feedback and iterating quickly are also key challenges. Additionally, you must be very careful when handling user data and privacy— even a simple tool or app can be vulnerable to data breaches or misuse. Always follow best practices for data protection and ensure you comply with relevant privacy regulations.

## Practical Exercise

Think of a simple problem you or your friends face regularly. Outline a basic app or tool that could solve this problem. Sketch the main features, describe your MVP, and plan how you would launch and gather feedback. If you don't have coding skills, consider using no-code tools or "vibe coding" your idea—focus on designing the user experience, workflows, and features, then use platforms like Glide, Bubble, or Figma to bring your concept to life without writing code.
