# Research Methods

Research methods are the tools and techniques product managers use to gather insights about users, problems, and opportunities. Choosing the right research method helps you deeply understand your target audience and validate your assumptions before building a solution. Common methods include interviews, surveys, observation, and data analysis.

## Example

Suppose you want to understand why many small business owners struggle with managing their inventory. You start by conducting user interviews with local shop owners to hear about their daily inventory challenges. Next, you send out a survey to a broader group of small businesses to identify common pain points and patterns. You also observe how inventory is tracked in a few stores and analyze online reviews of popular inventory management tools. By combining these research methods, you uncover that many owners find existing tools too complex and expensive, highlighting an opportunity for a simpler, more affordable solution.

## Pain Points

Selecting the right research method can be tricky—some approaches take more time or resources than others. It’s easy to bias your results with leading questions or by only talking to a narrow group of users. Interpreting qualitative data can also be challenging, especially if feedback is inconsistent or unclear.

## Practical Exercise

Pick a problem you’re interested in solving. Choose two research methods (for example, interviews and surveys) and use them to gather insights from potential users. Compare the results and see what new perspectives each method provides.
