# Observing Your Environment

Observing your environment is the first step in discovering valuable problems to solve as a product manager. This means paying close attention to the products, services, and processes you interact with every day, and noticing where things could be improved or where users experience frustration. By developing a habit of curiosity and observation, you can uncover opportunities that others might overlook.

## Example

You might notice that many professionals struggle to find the best AI tool for their specific use case. By observing online forums, social media discussions, or talking to colleagues, you see that people often feel overwhelmed by the number of options and lack guidance tailored to their needs, leading to wasted time and frustration. This recurring challenge could be an opportunity to create a solution that helps users discover and compare AI tools based on their unique requirements.

## Pain Points

It can be challenging to notice problems if you’re used to existing workflows or if you don’t interact with a diverse group of users. Sometimes, issues are hidden or users have adapted workarounds that mask the underlying problem. Staying open-minded and asking questions can help reveal these hidden opportunities.

## Practical Exercise

Spend a day paying extra attention to the tools, apps, and services you use. Write down any moments of frustration, confusion, or inefficiency you experience or observe in others. Review your notes and pick one problem that seems worth exploring further.
