# Problem Validation

Problem validation is the process of confirming that the problem you’ve identified is real, significant, and worth solving. This step helps ensure you don’t waste time building a solution for an issue that doesn’t actually matter to users. Validation often involves talking to potential users, gathering data, and testing assumptions to make sure your understanding of the problem matches reality.

## Example

Suppose you notice that many remote workers complain about feeling isolated and unmotivated during the workday. Before building a new virtual coworking platform, you decide to validate the problem. You run a short survey in remote work communities, asking about their biggest challenges. You also conduct a few interviews and discover that while isolation is common, most people have already found ways to cope—like joining existing online groups or using productivity apps. However, you notice a specific pain point: many struggle to find accountability partners for daily check-ins. This insight helps you refine your idea to focus on easy, daily accountability matching rather than building a full coworking platform.

## Pain Points

It can be tempting to skip validation if you’re excited about your idea, but building without evidence is risky. Sometimes users say a problem is important, but their actions show otherwise. Getting honest feedback and enough responses can also be challenging. Be prepared to adjust your idea based on what you learn.

## Practical Exercise

Take a problem you’ve identified for your side project. Create a short survey or interview script and reach out to at least five potential users. Ask them about their experiences and how they currently deal with the problem. Use their feedback to decide if the problem is worth solving or if you need to refine your focus.
