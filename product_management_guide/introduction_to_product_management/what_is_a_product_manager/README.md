## What is a Product Manager?

Product managers (PMs) are often considered the "voice of the customer" within the company, and they must balance various stakeholders' needs while meeting business objectives and solving problems for the user. 

It is a strategic role at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience. PMs are responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team that is responsible for improving it.

A Product Manager's role is inherently cross-functional, and they must work closely with teams across the organization to align visions, set objectives, and execute product development plans. Such responsibilities involve setting the product's strategy, defining its roadmap, and working with engineering, design, sales, marketing, and support to deliver a well-rounded product.
