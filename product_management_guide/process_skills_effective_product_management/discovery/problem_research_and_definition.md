### Problem Research and Definition

Problem research and definition involves identifying and understanding the problems that your product aims to solve. This process includes conducting user research, analyzing market trends, and leveraging data to gain insights into user needs and pain points. Defining the problem clearly and accurately is ***crucial*** for guiding your product development efforts and ensuring that your product delivers value to users.

#### Example

Let's consider a Product Manager at a dating app, like Tinder. They've been noticing a consistent drop in user engagement over the past few months. To understand the root cause of this issue, they start by analyzing user data and find that users are swiping right (indicating interest) less frequently than before. They also notice a significant drop in the number of messages exchanged between users.

To further investigate, they conduct a series of user interviews and surveys. Through this research, they discover that users are finding it increasingly difficult to find potential matches that align with their interests and preferences. Users express frustration about the lack of filtering options and the randomness of the matching algorithm.

Based on these findings, the Product Manager defines the problem statement: "Our users are struggling to find potential matches that align with their interests and preferences, leading to decreased engagement and satisfaction with our app." This problem statement is specific, user-focused, and actionable, providing a clear direction for the next steps in the product discovery process.

The Product Manager then shares this problem statement with their team and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands the issue at hand and aligns on the need to address it. This sets the stage for the next steps in the discovery process.

#### Pain Points

Problem research and definition can be challenging due to the complexity and variability of user needs and market conditions. It requires a deep understanding of your users, a keen eye for detail, and the ability to synthesize diverse sources of information.

#### Practical Exercise

Think about a product you use regularly. What problem does it solve for you? How could this problem be defined more clearly or accurately?
