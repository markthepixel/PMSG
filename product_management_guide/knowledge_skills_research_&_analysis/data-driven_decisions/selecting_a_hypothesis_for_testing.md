### Selecting a Hypothesis for Testing

The selection of a hypothesis for testing is a critical decision point in product management. It involves discerning which hypothesis, among many possible ones, will most effectively drive the product forward and provide meaningful insights. This section will guide Product Managers on how to prioritize hypotheses for testing without delving into the testing process itself.

#### Example

Continuing with the YouTube scenario, our Product Manager now faces multiple hypotheses derived from various assumptions. One hypothesis suggests that "Personalized learning paths will increase user session length," while another proposes that "Highlighting creator credentials will increase the credibility and viewership of educational content." To decide which hypothesis to test, the PM needs to consider several factors.

Firstly, the PM evaluates the potential impact. The hypothesis about personalized learning paths is expected to directly influence user engagement metrics, which are a strategic priority. Secondly, the PM assesses the feasibility. Implementing personalized learning paths is technologically viable within the platform's current capabilities. Thirdly, alignment with business goals is considered. The PM reflects on how well each hypothesis supports the overarching objectives of the platform.

After thorough consideration, the PM selects the hypothesis related to personalized learning paths, as it aligns closely with strategic goals, has high feasibility, and the potential impact on user engagement is significant. This hypothesis also has a clearly defined metric for measurement (session length), making it a strong candidate for testing.

#### Pain Points

The challenge in selecting a hypothesis lies in the ability to critically evaluate its potential against resource constraints, strategic alignment, and the potential for learning. Product Managers must balance the desire for innovation with the practicality of implementation and the necessity of measurable outcomes.

#### Practical Exercise

List down three hypotheses related to features or user behaviors in a product. For each, assess the potential impact, feasibility, and strategic alignment. Which hypothesis would you prioritize for testing and why? Document your reasoning process, as it will be crucial for justifying your decision to stakeholders.
