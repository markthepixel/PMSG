## Business Understanding

Business Understanding is critical for Product Managers to ensure that the products they manage not only meet market needs but also align with the strategic direction of the company. It encompasses a comprehensive grasp of the company's values, objectives, and priorities, as well as an understanding of the financial underpinnings that sustain a product's success. This knowledge forms the basis for strategic decision-making and long-term planning, underpinning the creation of products that are viable, competitive, and profitable.
