### Elements of Persuasion and Motivation

Persuasion and motivation are key elements of communication. They involve influencing others not through authority but through compelling arguments, emotional connection, and shared goals.

#### Example

Imagine a Product Manager at Airbnb who advocates for a new feature allowing users to take virtual property tours before booking. This feature offers immersive views that empower users to make more informed decisions and feel confident about their choices. Its potential to enhance customer satisfaction and drive revenue growth makes it a compelling proposition for Airbnb.

To win stakeholder support, the Product Manager emphasizes the impact this feature can have on revenue and user growth within the Airbnb platform itself. They present data demonstrating user feedback requesting more detailed property information and the positive correlation between improved property experiences and increased bookings. Emphasizing how this feature aligns with Airbnb's mission of creating a sense of belonging by making users feel at home in their chosen properties before arrival can further strengthen the argument.

The PM lays out a comprehensive plan that showcases the business impact, in this case, the potential return on investment. They also include the associated costs and risks, such as the need for 3D files and updated property photos. The PM suggests strategies to educate hosts on capturing high-quality visuals or explore partnerships with professional photographers to address the largest pain point. Creating a proof of concept or mock-up can help stakeholders visualize the immersive experience and solidify their support.

Motivating stakeholders, the Product Manager presents a compelling vision of how this feature positions Airbnb as an industry leader, offering innovative and customer-centric travel experiences. By differentiating itself in the market, Airbnb can attract new users, retain existing ones, and foster brand loyalty. This feature enhances the user experience and drives revenue growth through increased bookings and user satisfaction.

Ultimately, the Product Manager may need to explore an alternative approach for implementing virtual property tours that address cost and risk concerns by leadership. Instead of pursuing an elaborate 3D solution, they have implemented a more cost-effective and lower-risk option within their existing app. The new feature is a guided video recording experience for the host that uses the phoneâ€™s camera, ambient light sensor, and accelerometer to ensure the recording will be well-lit, level, and moving at an appropriate speed capturing each room.

#### Pain Points

Persuasion and motivation can be challenging, as they require a deep understanding of your audience's needs, values, and motivations. They also require the ability to present compelling arguments and inspire others.
