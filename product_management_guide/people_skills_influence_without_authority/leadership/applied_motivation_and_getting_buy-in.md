### Applied Motivation and Getting Buy-In

Applied motivation involves using persuasive communication and leadership skills to motivate your team, stakeholders, and leadership towards a shared goal. Getting buy-in is the process of gaining their support and commitment. Both are crucial for driving the successful execution of product **initiatives**.

Example: Imagine a Product Manager at a SaaS company that provides project management tools. They have identified an opportunity to develop a new AI-powered feature that predicts project risks based on historical data and current project parameters. However, this feature would require significant resources and a shift in the product roadmap.

To get buy-in for this initiative, the Product Manager would need to effectively communicate the value proposition of this feature and its potential impact on the company's competitive position. They might start by presenting market research data showing a growing demand for predictive analytics in project management and demonstrating how this feature could meet that demand and differentiate their product in the market.

To motivate the data science team, they could highlight the innovative nature of the project and the opportunity to work with cutting-edge AI technologies. For the sales and customer success teams, they might emphasize how this feature could help attract larger clients and improve customer satisfaction by helping clients proactively manage project risks.

The Product Manager would also need to address any concerns from different stakeholders, such as the potential impact on other planned features, the cost of AI processing, or the need for additional resources. By clearly communicating the vision and potential benefits of the feature, they could motivate the team and stakeholders and gain their buy-in for this significant shift in the product roadmap.

#### Pain Points

Gaining buy-in can be challenging when there are differing priorities or perspectives among the team or stakeholders. It's also important to maintain motivation and commitment throughout the project, especially when facing setbacks or changes.

#### Practical Exercise

Think of a new feature you would like to propose for your favorite app. How would you motivate your team and gain buy-in from stakeholders? What strategies would you use to communicate its benefits and potential impact?
