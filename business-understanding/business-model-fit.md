# Business Model Fit

Incorporating new features into a product requires a Product Manager to understand how these additions will fit within the existing business model and contribute to the company's economic goals. This includes considering production costs, potential revenue streams, and how the feature aligns with the company's value proposition. The process involves strategic planning to ensure the new feature enhances the customer experience and meets market demands without compromising profitability.

## Example

Imagine a Product Manager at Tesla is tasked with introducing a 'Pet Mode' feature, designed to maintain a safe and comfortable in-car environment for pets when owners need to briefly leave them in the vehicle. The PM must determine how this feature aligns with Tesla's mission of innovating for safety and customer convenience, as well as with their overarching business model.

The PM evaluates the market potential by identifying the size and purchasing power of the pet owner segment among Tesla owners and enthusiasts. Recognizing that pet safety is a significant concern for this demographic, the PM predicts that 'Pet Mode' could enhance the appeal of Tesla vehicles, potentially justifying a premium for this feature or incorporating it into an existing premium package.

In terms of development, the PM estimates costs for software updates and considers any necessary hardware adjustments. They also explore opportunities to partner with pet safety and comfort brands to co-market the feature. 'Pet Mode' is conceptualized not just as a standalone feature but as an integrated part of Tesla’s ecosystem, complementing the brand's image as an innovator in user-focused and safety-conscious design.

The PM anticipates that 'Pet Mode' could also generate indirect revenue by strengthening brand loyalty and influencing purchase decisions for pet-owning consumers. By strategically marketing this feature, Tesla can position itself as a brand that cares for all members of the family, including pets, aligning with the values of its target customers.

## Pain Points

Integrating new features into a product's business model presents challenges such as managing development costs, ensuring market competitiveness, and aligning with the product's value proposition. Product Managers must validate market demand while balancing innovation with the financial sustainability of the feature. This requires careful analysis and strategic foresight to maintain the product’s position in a dynamic market.

## Practical Exercise

Think of a feature that could add value to a product you use frequently. Outline how this feature could be integrated into the product's business model. Consider the costs involved, how it could generate revenue, and its alignment with the core value proposition of the product. What steps would you take to validate the demand for this feature before full-scale development?
