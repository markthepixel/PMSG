# The Product Mindset

This mindset focuses on delivering value to the customer through your product. It involves thinking about the product from the customer's perspective and deciding what will best serve their needs. This mindset is essential as it guarantees that the product you create is centered around the customer and addresses market demands. It requires you to consistently frame the problem you're solving within the broader context of the company's overall direction and objectives and the specific focus of your product area. Being a Product Manager is a continuous balancing act between the business's desires, the users' needs, and the practicalities of the real world.

## Example

Amazon is an excellent example of a company with a strong product mindset. One of their leadership principles is "Customer Obsession," which means they always start with the customer and work backward. This principle is deeply ingrained in their product development process.

For instance, when developing the Kindle, Amazon started with the goal of creating the best possible reading experience for customers. They identified pain points with traditional reading, such as the inability to carry multiple books simultaneously, the physical space books take up, and the difficulty of obtaining new titles. Working backward from these customer needs, they developed the Kindle. This e-reader addressed these issues by allowing users to instantly store thousands of books on a single device and download new titles.

They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust, continually seeking to understand their customers' needs and develop innovative solutions to meet them.

## Pain Points

One of the challenges of embracing a product mindset is striking the right balance between fulfilling customer needs and aligning with business objectives. It is crucial to manage stakeholder expectations while keeping the customer at the center of decision-making. There are often constraints, such as limited time and resources, making this balancing act more challenging.

## Practical Exercise

Take a moment to reflect on a product or service you use daily. Consider how it delivers value to you as a customer and think about potential areas for improvement. How could the product better meet your needs and enhance your overall experience?
