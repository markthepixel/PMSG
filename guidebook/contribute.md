* Type in a little note explaining what you have changed and why then click **Propose changes**.
* This will create a **Pull Request** which someone will review.
* Thanks very much!!!



### 2. Request Content

If you're not familiar with editing in Github or Markdown, you can still contribute by creating an "issue" (a ticket, idea, suggestion) in GitHub.

You can think of this as similar as writing a Jira or Linear ticket. You will need a free Github account.
